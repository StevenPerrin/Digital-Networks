# Static IP addresses

##### A static IP address or fixed IP address is an Internet Protocol (IP) address number assigned to a network device by an administrator. A static IP is an alternative to a dynamic IP assignment on Internet Protocol networks.

##### A simple way to think of an IP address is to think of a mailing address for a house, or a personal phone number or email address.
